/** CCLabelBNFont is a subclass of CCSprite
 
 Features:
 - Can be used with other CCSprites in the same CCSpriteBatchNode
 - Treats each character like a CCSprite. This means that each individual character can be:
 - rotated
 - scaled
 - translated
 - tinted
 - chage the opacity
 - It can be used as part of a menu item.
 - anchorPoint can be used to align the "label"
 - Supports AngelCode text format
 
 Limitations:
 - All inner characters are using an anchorPoint of (0.5f, 0.5f) and it is not recommend to change it
 because it might affect the rendering
 
 CCLabelBNFont implements the protocol CCLabelProtocol, like CCLabel and CCLabelAtlas.
 CCLabelBNFont has the flexibility of CCLabel, the speed of CCLabelAtlas and all the features of CCSprite.
 If in doubt, use CCLabelBNFont instead of CCLabelAtlas / CCLabel.
